# ExpenseEase
### Description -
ExpenseEase is a Expense Management Web app that is a comprehensive application designed to 
help users track and manage their expenses efficiently. It offers a user-friendly interface for 
adding, editing, and deleting expenses, making it easier for individuals to keep a close 
watch on their financial activities.

### Technology used - <br>
I utilized the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. MongoDB was chosen as the database to store expense data. Express.js 
provided a robust backend framework for handling API routes. React was used for building 
the frontend user interface, offering a dynamic and responsive experience. Node.js was 
employed to run the server-side code, ensuring seamless communication between the 
frontend and backend components.


### Features - <br>
<li>The key features of ExpenseEase is app include the ability to add new expenses with details such as description, amount, and date.</li>
<li>Users can also edit existing expenses to keep the data accurate and relevant. Furthermore, the app allows for the 
deletion of expenses when they are no longer needed.</li>
<li>All these features come together to offer a comprehensive expense tracking solution.</li>

### Deployment
Both the frontend and backend components of the app were deployed separately. The 
frontend was hosted on a web server, while the backend was deployed to a platform like 
render. This decoupled deployment approach allowed for easy scalability and maintenance.
